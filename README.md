- **System logs** with filtering and search capabilities
- **Start/stop container runtime** as needed

### üìä Advanced Logging
- **Universal logs viewer** supporting multiple log types:
  - Container runtime logs
  - Container boot logs
  - System logs
- **Multi-window support** for viewing multiple log streams simultaneously
- **Search and filtering** with real-time text search
- **Export capabilities** for log analysis
- **Native macOS UI** with line numbers and word wrap options

## Requirements

- **macOS 15.0** or later
- **Apple's container CLI tool** installed and accessible
- **Xcode 15.0** or later (for building from source)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

The app requires Apple's `container` CLI tool to be installed. This is typically available through:

```bash
# Check if container tool is available
which container

# The app will look for the tool in these locations:
# /usr/local/bin/container
# /opt/homebrew/bin/container
# /usr/bin/container
# Or via PATH lookup
```

### Building from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd container-ui
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode:**
   ```bash
   open ContainerUI/ContainerUI.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Build and run:**
   - Select the ContainerUI scheme
   - Press `Cmd+R` to build and run
   - Or use command line: `xcodebuild -scheme ContainerUI -configuration Debug`

## Architecture

ContainerUI follows a modern SwiftUI architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Project Structure
```
ContainerUI/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Application/          # App entry point and configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/              # Core data models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services/            # Business logic and CLI integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Screens/             # Feature-based UI organization
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Containers/      # Container management views
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Images/         # Image management views
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Logs/           # Universal logs system
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ System/         # System management views
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Shared/             # Reusable components and utilities
```

### Key Technologies
- **SwiftUI** with NavigationSplitView for native three-column layout
- **JSON parsing** for rich CLI data extraction
- **Async/await** for modern concurrency
- **Multi-window support** for enhanced productivity
- **Sandbox-compatible** process execution

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Launch ContainerUI** from Applications folder or Xcode
2. **Container system** will automatically start if needed
3. **Browse containers** in the left sidebar under "Containers"
4. **Select a container** to view details in the right inspector
5. **Manage containers** using context menus or inspector actions

### Container Operations

- **Right-click containers** for quick actions (start, stop, delete, logs)
- **Use the inspector** for detailed information and advanced operations
- **Create new containers** using the "New Container" button
- **View logs** by clicking "View Logs" - opens in a dedicated window

### Image Management

- **Switch to "Images" tab** to browse available container images
- **View image details** including size, registry, and architecture
- **Create containers** directly from images
- **Delete unused images** to free up disk space

### System Management

- **Access "System" tab** for container runtime management
- **Monitor system status** and resource usage
- **Manage DNS domains** for container networking
- **View system logs** for troubleshooting

## Development

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build project
xcodebuild -scheme ContainerUI -configuration Debug build

# Run application
xcodebuild -scheme ContainerUI -configuration Debug

# Clean build
xcodebuild clean
```

### Sandboxing

For development, you may need to temporarily disable App Sandbox:
- Set `ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX = NO` in build settings
- This allows access to external CLI tools
- **Not suitable for App Store distribution**

For production deployment, consider:
- **XPC Service** for secure CLI execution
- **Embedded helper tool** bundled with the app
- See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed architecture guidance

## CLI Integration

ContainerUI integrates with Apple's `container` CLI using JSON output for reliable parsing:

- **Containers:** `container ls -a --format json`
- **Images:** `container image ls --format json`
- **System:** `container system *` commands
- **Logs:** `container logs` with various filters
